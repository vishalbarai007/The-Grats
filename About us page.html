        <p>He was the very first purusha as brahman thus his name was given as Idandra but the God likes to call him the Indra. 
            When Indra shed his semen in his wife that gives the very first birth which was the non-different from her. 
            That was just like her own limb (body part) which doesn’t hurt her. The wife nourishes the child in her embryo and husband protects her and the child.
            After the very first birth the husband has to protect his son and himself for the continuance of this world. The was his second state of his life i.e.
             his second birth. As the child grow older the responsibilities came on him and the father got passed away and took new birth again that was his third birth.
              Further came the Vamadev , he saw the birth of all the gods when he was in his mother’s womb.
